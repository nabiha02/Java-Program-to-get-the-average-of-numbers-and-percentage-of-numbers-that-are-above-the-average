# Java-Program-to-get-the-average-of-numbers-and-percentage-of-numbers-that-are-above-the-average
Declare an integer array of size 10, initialize it with user input, and calculate and print the average. Now calculate the percentage of numbers that are above that average. For example: if 5 of the array elements are greater than average, the percentage is: 6 * 100 / 10 = 60%
